Clinical Electronic Health Records (EHRs) capture the digital history of each medical patient at a hospital, and are increasingly becoming commonplace in the modern medical workflow. EHRs contain invaluable information for training predictive neural networks, which have historically succeeded in estimating patient readmission and relapse. However, the direct use of patient EHRs within ML datasets has been shown to comprimise the security of sensitive patient information, as attackers may readily reverse-engineer network inputs. As a result, regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR have been erected to limit the use of patient data. 

In this thesis, we seek to mitigate data privacy concerns while maintaining applicability in an ML-training context by synthesizing new EHRs which capture the medical trends and distributions as in real data without directly exposing any patient's data to the downstream models.
